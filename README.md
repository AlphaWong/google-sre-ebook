# Build

## Docker (Preferred)

Requirements:

-   Docker

```
$ docker run --rm --volume "$(pwd):/output" captn3m0/google-sre-ebook:latest
```

-   You should see the final EPUB/MOBI/PDF files in the `output` directory after the above runs.
-   The file may be owned by the root user.

**NOTE:** You'll have to allow docker access to a directory that's local to your system. The safest way to do this is as follows:

```
$ mkdir /tmp/sreoutput
$ chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /tmp/sreoutput
$ docker run --rm --volume "/tmp/sreoutput:/output" captn3m0/google-sre-ebook:latest
```

The build for the above Docker image can be audited at <https://cloud.docker.com/swarm/captn3m0/repository/docker/captn3m0/google-sre-ebook/builds>.

## macOS

Requirements:

-   Ruby
-   `gem install bundler`
-   `bundle install`
-   `brew install pandoc`
-   `brew cask install calibre`
-   `brew install wget`
